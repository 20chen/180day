1、图片均匀地铺满每一列？![image-20180811123345920](/var/folders/nx/cxvcsxzs537gqb791j0280pm0000gn/T/abnerworks.Typora/image-20180811123345920.png)

2、模拟高速旋转后慢慢停止？rotate()?

3、变形的原点不一样，变形直接作用在<div>上还是<img>上会影响最后效果。

4、transition transform animation??

Transform（变形）,transition（过渡）

So what are transforms and transitions? At their most basic level, **transforms move or change the appearance of an element**, while **transitions make the element smoothly and gradually change** from one state to another.

Now that we reviewed how to make smooth and gradual transitions, let’s look at CSS transforms - how to make an element change from one state to another. With the CSS transform property you can **rotate, move, skew, and scale elements**. (This post will only cover 2D transforms, but stay tuned for future blog posts on 3D transforms.)

Transforms are triggered when an element changes states, such as on mouse-hover or mouse-click. The examples in this post will demonstrate transforms on mouse-hover.

transform：响应事件，平滑地一个状态变到另一个状态

5、重复的变形能合并？

6、旋转度数=360deg*圈数

7、加载页面时样式没有渲染怎么办？

8、多个div重叠
